Q: Why do you think Solana has chosen during most of its history to use Typescript for Client side
development?

Solana leans on TypeScript for client-side development mainly because it lowers the barrier for builders. Most developers already know JavaScript, and TypeScript brings the same ecosystem plus type safety. That means you can use the huge npm library base, plug directly into browsers and wallets like Phantom, and still get strong types.

TypeScript is speed and safety. Itâ€™s quick to prototype scripts in Node or build UIs in React, but the compiler catches a lot of errors before you ever sign a transaction. Since Anchor and tools like Codama can generate TypeScript clients straight from an IDL, you get a frictionless workflow: write your program in Rust, export an IDL, and immediately consume it in a strongly-typed way.
